# php_functions
A collection of common routines I wanted to save.

Current Functions:
  makeJSON($fileName,$contents,$permissions)
  Creates JSON file. If path to file doesnt exist, it creates it as well.
  
  print_br($string_to_print)
    echos the $string, while adding the "<br>" tag. No more echo $string . '<br>';
